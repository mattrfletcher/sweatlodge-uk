<h1> The Sweat Lodge </h1>

<p>We are a community with connections to the Blood Reserve, Canada, holding sweatlodges
in rural South Oxfordshire that honour the lineage of the Blackfoot Sundance tradition.</p>

<p>The ceremony was brought to this land around the year 2000, by a Blackfoot Sundance leader,
elder and lodge leader who passed on the tradition over several years, and we now have
community members attending the annual Sundance ceremonies in Canada. </p>

<p>The sweat lodge is an ancient earth based medicine tradition calling on mother earth,
father sky and the four directions to come and help us in a sacred way. </p>

<p>We hold a Mixed community lodge every month, in all weathers, as well as men's and
women's lodges whenever possible.</p>
