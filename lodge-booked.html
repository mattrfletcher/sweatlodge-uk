  <h1>Lodge Booked Information<h1>

  <h2>How to prepare for the lodge</h2>

<p>We advise drinking lots of water on the day before the lodge so that you arrive well
hydrated. Water will be available during the day too. </p>

<p>We also refraining from any drugs or alcohol for at least 72 hours before the
ceremony. A sweat lodge is a very powerful tool to help with alcohol/drug addictions
and so it can a wonderful support alongside AA or NA but you need to be clear of
these for at least 72 hours.</p>

<h2>What to bring</h2>

<p><strong>Outdoor clothes and footwear </strong> – We spend the day (before, after and in-between the
lodge rounds) in a field so please have warm and waterproof clothes as needed
according to the season/forecast. We do have a cabin but our ceremony involves lots
of outdoor time. </p>

<p><strong>1 set of clothes for the lodge</strong> - Loose fitting clothes made of light material are best.
Men usually wear shorts and women wear sarongs, with swimwear underneath or
long skirts, trousers t-shirts or vest etc). Please ensure you are dressed respectfully
(no speedos or see through clothing please - it is a ceremony after all). Also do bear
in mind that your clothes will get wet and maybe muddy!</p>

<p><strong>1 or 2 towels and/or a small mat</strong> - A dry towel comes in handy during and after the
sweats. Also use one, or a pillow or small mat to sit on inside the Lodge if you don’t
want to sit directly on the grass.</p>

<p><strong>Flip-flops/sandals</strong> – Handy to wear in between the lodge rounds.</p>

<p><strong>Torch </strong> - In the winter months when it is dark after the Lodge bring a torch to light
your way.</p>

<p><strong>Light food and drink for yourself for the day. </strong>Water isavailable on site but we do
advise bringing your own water bottle (preferably not plastic) and drinking lots of
water.</p>

<p><strong>Food to share with everyone at the meal afterwards.</strong> afterwards.It is traditional to have a feast
together after the Lodge, so all participants are encouraged to contribute something
towards this <strong>and please bring your own cup, plate and cutlery. </strong></p>

<h2>Ceremonial Things</h2>

<p><strong>Pouch of tobacco </strong> It is respectful to bring this as an offering. An ordinary sized
packet of cigarette tobacco is fine. </p>

<p><strong>Small gift for each of the 2 fire-keepers </strong> These individuals work very hard in
support of the Sweat Lodge and it is traditional for participants to offer them a gift.
A traditional gift would be: food, item, book, picture, crystal, feather, candles, beaded
bracelet/necklace, dream-catchers, herbs - whatever comes from the heart is
appropriate. </p>

<p><strong>If you have something you would like blessed </strong> anything such as a crystal,
ring,photograph, amulet etc it can be placed on the altar just outside the Lodge. </p>

<h2> Smokers </h2>

<p> We ask that all those who smoke are respectful and mindful of others
and that it is kept to a minimum; there is a no smoking policy around the Lodge and
food areas. If you do smoke please don’t leave your cigarette butts lying around and
never throw them (or anything) on the fire, as it is considered a sacred ceremonial
fire. </p>
