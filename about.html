<h1> What Happens at a Sweat Lodge </h1>

  <p>Come and join us for a beautiful lodge amongst the stunning hills of South Oxfordshire. </p>

<p>Our sweat lodge runs all day and finishes some time in the evening. We ask people to arrive around 10am for a 10.30 start. </p>

<h2> Fire Lighting Ceremony </h2>

<p>The day begins with the Fire lighting ceremony so that we can
heat the stones. The lodge leaders will call you to stand into a
circle and explain how the day will unfold. Then the fire keepers
light the fire and this then becomes a ceremonial fire, so please do
not throw any rubbish on there. If you wish to burn something
on the fire, please ask the firekeepers. </p>

<p>We then build the lodge together. The wooden structure is already
in place but we place the blankets over the lodge and collect the
drinkingwater etc.</p>

<p>As the stones heat up on the fire, there’s plenty of time to eat some
lunch, walk in the woods, chat or gaze into the fire.</p>

<h2>Sharing Circle </h2>

<p>Once the stones are almost ready, we stand together in circle so
that everyone can introduce themselves. It’s an opportunity for
people to share what has drawn them to the lodge. People can say
as much or as little as they wish</p>

<h2> Sweat Lodge </h2>

<p>At this point we get changed into our lodge clothes and enter the
lodge. There are at least 4 rounds (sometimes 5). After each round
we come out of the lodge and take time to cool down and drink
water before we go back in for the next round. </p>

<h2> Pipe Ceremony </h2>

<p>Then we end with a pipe ceremony, either inside the lodge or the
tipi. The pipes are filled with herbs, flowers and a small amount of
tobacco. You are welcome to smoke the pipes as part of this
ceremony if you wish but there is no pressure to do so.</p>

<h2> Feast </h2>

<p>We all get changed and share the food we have all brought.</p>

<p>Our sweat lodge has been running here for over 15 years and it's run by volunteers who have spent many years training within the tradition. <p>
<p>Our lineage leads back to the Blackfoot (Blood reserve) in Canada.</p>
