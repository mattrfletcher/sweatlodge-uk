<p>I have been attending inipi ( sweatlodge) ceremonies for over 12 years.
I have sat with Dene, Abenaki, Meeshka ( Mexico), Iroquois, Shinnecock tribes
and Non-native lead sweat lodges. I can say with confidence that this community
is bonafide and adheres to the Native way of life, in particular their association
with the Blackfoot has been impeccable. There is no smoke screen shamans wanting money.
They are here as human beings wanting to share in the blessing of creator.
I would encourge anyone to attend this lodge who is just starting so they can get on the right foot.
I have been welcomed, my spiritual and creative gifts have been encouraged and
I feel a part of the community in a blessed way. Thank you Oxfordshire Sweat lodge!</p>

‘I have been attending this Sweat Lodge for over ten years now.
It has been an extra-ordinary boon to be able to connect to with a kind and humble community
of people who remain true to the Black Foot ancestry of this tradition. The day always follow
the same path of ceremony and ritual but the experience and the learning I take from it is always different.
It brings one back in a safe and disciplined way to one’s true self. At one level it the sweat Lodge experience
is a spiritual sauna at another it is an opportunity to connect with one’s depths and to find peace.
In the Lodge I have met people from all walks of love and been humbled by our common humanity
and soulful connection. The lodge is a safe space to confront one’s vulnerability and to take a day
out of normal time to connect and just be. I thoroughly recommend it and the good people
who maintain this extraordinary tradition.

  Thank you, for a very beautiful day. One of my friends was very scared about going into the sweat lodge
  and not being able to cope with the heat but you helped to make her feel at ease through the way you
  supported her and guided her through this experience.</p>

  <p>We all had such a lovely time and got to meet some great people.
  It didn't matter if we had come with friends or on our own because each of us quickly felt connected
  to each otherbecause of the way you brought us together and lead us through the ancient traditions.</p>

  <p>It was so good, I would love to come back!</p>
